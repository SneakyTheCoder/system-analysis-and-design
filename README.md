# system-analysis-and-design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for the DriverPass project was the company DriverPass, who is a compnay that is focused on improving student success on driving license exams. The client requested web-based training system that would prepare students for written driving exams through online practices, and for in-person driving exams by scheduling in-person driving lessons. The client requested that students have the ability to enroll themselves as well as the ability for support members to assist with over the phone enrollment as well. This system also required that administrators and instructors have access to the appropriate management abilities so that they may adjust their lessons, student progress, and available content.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel as though I did really well at analyzing and extracting the neccassary requirements and translating them into understandable visual models like the use case diagrams, activity diagrams, uml diagrams, and sequence diagrams. These diagrams helped to clearly outline the functionality of the system and its relationship to the user and other objects. I feel as though these lead to a higher quality product being produced to the client overall.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One thing I would focus on more are the nonfunctional requirements like security and modularity. I would like to improve these to ensure that my system is completely secure at handling and storing specific data so that I can keep my clients user data as secure as possible and ensure a higher quality product. Modularity would also help to ensure that my system can be improved and changed easily without a complete rewrite to ensure an easier to maintain product to the client at the end of the project.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interperting the users needs can best be done by sitting down for an interview and discussing the various goals of the system or project. This helps breakdown the clients vision for the project and helps the team better understand the problem the client is trying to solve. This is also a great time to point out any restrictions or hinderances to the client to ensure that they have a realistic expectation as well. Understanding who will be interacting and using this system is also very important and might be question the team brings up to better understand the key roles and different accesses required for the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

It is best to begin designing software by first gathering all of the needed requirements and then breaking the full system down into smaller managable chunks using different diagrams and models to represent the different actions and functions of the system. In future projects I will definately be utilizing these diagraming tools for not only my clients but to help me better understand the bigger picture of the system. These strategies help to ensure that the final product is both functional and client focused.
